    <section name="Building Functor">
      <p>
         To build Commons Functor from scratch, you must first obtain the source,
         from 
         <a href="source-repository.html">the SVN server</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         In order to build Commons Functor you will need <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>. 
         Install a recent Maven release.
         <!--
         The <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/gump">Gump</a>
         continuous integration process attempts to build Functor several times a day (against the built-from-scratch
         versions of all of it's dependencies), and notifies the development team if it does not succeed. 
         You can 
         <a href="http://cvs.apache.org/builds/gump/latest/commons-functor.html">view the status of the latest gump build here</a>.
         -->
      </p>
      <p>
            With Maven installed, you should be able to run an arbitrary maven goal from the root Commons Functor 
            directory.  Commonly used goals include 
            <code>clean</code>, <code>test</code>, <code>compile</code>, <code>package</code>, <code>install</code> and <code>site</code>.
