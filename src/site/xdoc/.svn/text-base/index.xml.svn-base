    <section name="Commons Functor: Function Objects for Java">
      <p>
         A <em>functor</em> is a function that can be manipulated 
         as an object, or an object representing a single, generic
         function.
      </p>
      <p>
         Functors support and encourage a number of powerful programming 
         techniques including:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>programming in a functional style</li>
         <li>higher order functions</li>
         <li>internal iterators</li>
         <li>reuse and specialization through composition rather than inheritance and overloading</li>
         <li>generic "callback" or "extension point" APIs</li>
         <li>generic "filters" or predicate APIs</li>
         <li>
            many "behavioral" design patterns, such as 
            Visitor, Strategy, Chain of Responsibility, etc.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         See the <a href="examples.html">examples</a> for more information on some of 
         these techniques.

         <emphasis>Commons Functor</emphasis> defines three general types of
         functors:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>predicates</dt>
        <dd>functors that return a <code>boolean</code> value</dd>
        <dt>functions</dt>
        <dd>functors that return an <code>Object</code> value</dd>
        <dt>procedures</dt>
        <dd>functors that don't return anything</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The root 
        <code><a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/functor/package-summary.html">functor</a></code>
        package defines three signatures for each functor type--taking zero, one or 
        two <code>Object</code> arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 
        <a href="apidocs/index.html">remaining packages</a>
        provide common functor implementations, adapters and utilities.
