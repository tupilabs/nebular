    <section name="Examples">
      <p>
         We've begun to develop some example code that demonstrates the use and
         utility of the Functor component.
      </p>
      <p>
         In order to keep the examples in sync with the rest of the code,         
         each example is written as a <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a> 
         <code>TestCase</code>.  The example programs are executed along with 
         all the other unit tests, and can be invoked via <code>mvn test</code> 
         once you've set up Maven as described in the 
         <a href="building.html">build instructions</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         If you're not familiar with JUnit, don't worry. An understanding of 
         JUnit isn't important for an understanding of these examples, and 
         we'll walk you through the relevant bits anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
         Two things you'll want to know about JUnit are (a) all the methods
         annotated with "@Test" will be executed automatically by the 
         test runner and (b) there are various "assert" methods present in 
         org.junit.Assert that can be used to make assertions about the Objects 
         being tested.  If any assertion fails, the JUnit framework will count 
         (and report) this as a test failure.
      </p>
      <p>You can run a specific test case or sub-suite in Maven by invoking</p>
      <pre>mvn -e -X -Dtest==&lt;fully-specified-test-case-name&gt; test</pre>
      <p>For example, to run the Quicksort example, invoke</p>
      <pre>mvn -e -X -Dtest=org.apache.commons.functor.example.QuicksortExample test</pre>
      <p>To run all the examples, invoke:</p>
      <pre>mvn -e -X -Dtest==&lt;fully-specified-package-name.*&gt; test</pre>    
      <p>
         Each example is has descriptive prose mixed right in with the source, as 
         <code>/* C++ style */</code> comments.

          "Pragmatic" Dave Thomas has been 
          <a href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave/">blogging</a> 
          a series of programming exercises he calls 
          <a href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata">Code Katas</a>.
          These exercises are intended to provide "practice sessions" that allow
          programmers to hone their craft.  The notion is borrowed from the 
          practice of Karate, where, in Dave's words 
          "a kata is an exercise where you repeat a form many, many times, 
          making little improvements in each".
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we use several of Dave's Code Katas to explore the
          Commons-Functor library.

            one might implement supermarket pricing rules, like "three for a dollar" or "buy two get one free".
            By encapsulating tiny bits of logic, functors provide a useful solution to this problem, as 
            illustrated in the 
            <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/functor/trunk/src/test/java/org/apache/commons/functor/example/kata/one/SupermarketPricingExample.java">SupermarketPricingExample</a>.

            get past three or four implementations, is more difficult that it sounds.

          The <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/functor/trunk/src/test/java/org/apache/commons/functor/example/lines/">lines</a>
          package demonstrates a functional approach to IO using Generators and the Algorithms class.

      <subsection name="Reuse Through Composition">
         <p>
            The Functor package, and more generally, a functional approach
            to program design, supports a powerful technique for balancing 
            behavior specialization and code reuse.
         </p>
         <p>
            Traditional Object Oriented design suggests inheritence as a
            mechanism code reuse, and method overloading as a mechanism for
            specialization.  For example, one defines a general purpose, perhaps
            even abstract class, say <i>AbstractList</i>, and then extend or 
            specialize this parent via subclasses, inheriting some behaviors 
            and overloading others.
         </p>
         <p>
            Functors encourage another, complementary approach to code reuse
            and behavior specialiazation: composition.  Following a compositional
            design, we create a number of simple objects and then combine them to 
            create more complex behaviors.  For example, the 
            <a href="http://commons.apache.org/pool/">Commons Pool</a> 
            component defines an <code>ObjectPool</code> type that maintains
            a collection of pooled objects, but delegates to a 
            <code>PoolableObjectFactory</code> to create, validate and destroy 
            the objects to be pooled.  Arbitrary <code>ObjectPool</code> 
            implementations can be composed with arbitrary 
            <code>PoolableObjectFactory</code>
            implementations in order to create new types of pools.
         </p>
         <p>
            The

            applies this design to <code>java.util.Map</code>, demonstrating how 
            "pluggable" functors can be applied to a generic <code>Map</code> structure in order
            to introduce new behaviors.
